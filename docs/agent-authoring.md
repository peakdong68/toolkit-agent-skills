# Agent Authoring Guide

Agents are specialized sub-agents that Claude Code dispatches for focused or parallel work.

## File Format

Each agent is a single markdown file in `agents/`:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: One-line description of what this agent does
model: sonnet
---

# My Agent

```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |

| `model` | No | Preferred model (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`). Defaults to parent model. |

## Dispatch Triggers

Agents are dispatched by skills or by the user via the `Agent` tool. Document when your agent should be dispatched:

- From which skills
- Under what conditions
- What input it expects

## Output Format

Define a clear output structure so the calling context can use the agent's results:

```markdown
## Output Format
Return a JSON-structured summary:
- `findings`: array of issues found
- `severity`: high/medium/low for each
- `recommendations`: suggested fixes
```
