## Ralph Integration  — Autonomous iterative development loops 

The toolkit integrates key concepts from [Ralph](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) and the [Ralph Playbook](https://github.com/ClaytonFarr/ralph-playbook) — an autonomous AI development methodology by Geoffrey Huntley.

### Autonomous Loop (`/ralph` or `/loop`)

Iterative development cycle: **PLANNING** → **BUILDING** → **STATUS CHECK** → repeat until done.

- **ONE task per loop** — each iteration selects and completes exactly one task
- **Context efficiency** — main context at 40-60% utilization, up to 5 parallel read subagents
- **Upstream/downstream steering** — specs shape inputs, tests/builds/lints create backpressure
- **Dual-condition exit gate** — requires both completion language AND explicit `EXIT_SIGNAL: true`

### Circuit Breaker

Safety mechanism preventing infinite loops and resource exhaustion:

- Opens after 3 loops with no progress, 5 identical errors, or 70% output decline
- 30-minute cooldown before retry
- Rate limiting (configurable calls per hour)
- File protection prevents accidental config deletion

### JTBD Specifications (`/specs`)

Jobs to Be Done methodology for writing implementation-free specs:

- Break requirements into topics of concern
- "One Sentence Without 'And'" test for proper scoping
- Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- SLC (Simple/Lovable/Complete) release planning

### Acceptance Testing & LLM-as-Judge

- **Acceptance testing** — backpressure chain: specs → tests → code (fix code, not specs)
- **LLM-as-judge** — structured rubric evaluation for subjective criteria (tone, UX, readability)
