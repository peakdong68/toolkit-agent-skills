## 3 RALPH AUTONOMOUS LOOP PROTOCOL

### Architecture

The Ralph loop is an iterative development cycle inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's technique. Each iteration loads identical context, executes one focused task, and persists state to disk.

### "ONE Task Per Loop" Principle

Each iteration selects and completes exactly ONE task from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. This reduces context switching and enables clear progress measurement.

### Context Efficiency


| Resource            | Budget             | Strategy                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Main context window | 40-60% utilization | The "smart zone" — enough room to think   |
| Read subagents      | Up to 500 parallel | Via `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="Explore"` |
| Build subagents     | 1 at a time        | Via `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="general-purpose"` |
| Token format        | Prefer Markdown    | ~30% more efficient than JSON             |


### Steering Mechanisms

**Upstream Steering (shaping inputs):**

- Detailed specs loaded first (~5,000 tokens)
- Identical PROMPT + AGENTS files each iteration
- Existing code patterns guide new generation

**Downstream Steering (validation gates):**

- Tests → reject invalid implementations
- Builds → catch compilation errors
- Linters → enforce style consistency
- Typecheckers → verify contracts
- LLM-as-judge → evaluate subjective criteria

### RALPH_STATUS Block

**[HARD-GATE:STATUS]** Every loop iteration ends with:

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: [IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKED]
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: [number]
FILES_MODIFIED: [number]
TESTS_STATUS: [PASSING | FAILING | NOT_RUN]
WORK_TYPE: [IMPLEMENTATION | TESTING | DOCUMENTATION | REFACTORING]
EXIT_SIGNAL: [false | true]
RECOMMENDATION: [one-line next action or completion summary]
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

### Dual-Condition Exit Gate

**[HARD-GATE:EXIT]** Both must be true to exit:

1. **Completion indicators** — "done" language appears >= 2 times in recent output
2. **Explicit EXIT_SIGNAL** — `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` in status block

EXIT_SIGNAL is true ONLY when: no remaining tasks, all tests pass, no errors, no meaningful work left.

### Circuit Breaker Thresholds


| Condition        | Threshold                              | Action                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| No progress      | 3 consecutive loops, 0 tasks completed | OPEN circuit            |
| Identical errors | 5 consecutive identical errors         | OPEN circuit            |
| Output decline   | 70% decline in output volume           | OPEN circuit            |
| Cooldown         | 30 minutes                             | Before retry after OPEN |


### File Protection

**[HARD-GATE:PROTECT]** These paths must NEVER be deleted during autonomous operations:

- `.ralph/`, `.ralphrc`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `specs/`

---

## 4 SPECIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### JTBD → Topics → Specs → Story Map

1. **Identify Jobs:** "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."
2. **Break into Topics:** Apply "One Sentence Without 'And'" test
3. **Write Specs:** Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, no implementation details
4. **Organize:** Story map with capabilities × release slices

### The Cardinal Rule

**[HARD-GATE:SPEC]** Specs must NEVER contain implementation details:


| Forbidden                   | Allowed                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Code blocks, function names | Behavioral descriptions                  |
| Technology choices          | Capability requirements                  |
| Algorithm suggestions       | Success criteria with measurable targets |


### Acceptance Criteria Format

```markdown
### [Criterion Name]
- Given [precondition]
- When [action]
- Then [observable behavioral outcome]
```

### SLC Release Criteria


| Criterion    | Question                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Simple**   | Can it ship fast with narrow scope?  |
| **Lovable**  | Will people actually want to use it? |
| **Complete** | Does it fully accomplish a job?      |


All three must be satisfied for a release.

### Reverse Engineering (Brownfield)

For existing codebases without specs:

1. Exhaustively trace every code path, data flow, state mutation
2. Produce specs stripped of implementation details
3. Document actual behavior (bugs = "documented features")
4. Run completeness checklist (all entry points, branches, errors documented)

---

## 5 QUALITY & VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### The Backpressure Chain

```
SPECS ──derives──▶ TESTS ──validates──▶ CODE
  ▲                                       │
  └──────── backpressure ─────────────────┘
  (if tests fail, fix code — not specs or tests)
```

### Validation Gates (all must pass before completion)


| Gate              | Tool                       | Required                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Unit tests        | Test runner                | Always                  |
| Integration tests | Test runner                | When applicable         |
| Acceptance tests  | Test runner (from spec AC) | Always                  |
| Build             | Build tool                 | Always                  |
| Lint              | Linter                     | Always                  |
| Typecheck         | Type checker               | When applicable         |
| LLM-as-judge      | Subagent evaluation        | For subjective criteria |
| Code review       | code-reviewer agent        | Before merge            |


### TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR

1. **RED:** Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **GREEN:** Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR:** Clean up while keeping tests green

**[HARD-GATE:TDD]** No production code without a failing test first.

### LLM-as-Judge Pattern

For subjective criteria (tone, aesthetics, UX, readability):

1. Define rubric dimensions with weights (sum to 1.0)
2. Set anchor points (1=worst, 5=adequate, 10=best)
3. Set passing threshold (5.0 minimum viable, 7.0 production, 8.5 excellence)
4. Evaluate artifact against rubric
5. Score, reason, suggest improvements
6. Pass/fail against threshold

### Code Review Checklist

1. **Plan alignment** — Does code match the approved plan?
2. **Code quality** — Clean, readable, maintainable?
3. **Architecture** — Consistent with existing patterns?
4. **Tests** — Adequate coverage? Acceptance tests present?
5. **Documentation** — Updated where needed?

Issue categorization: **Critical** (must fix) | **Important** (should fix) | **Suggestions** (consider)

## 6 MEMORY MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

### Memory Files


| File                  | Purpose                                | Updated By                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `project-context.md`  | Tech stack, architecture, dependencies | `self-learning`, manual        |
| `learned-patterns.md` | Coding conventions and patterns        | `self-learning`, `code-review` |
| `user-preferences.md` | Communication and workflow preferences | `self-learning`, manual        |
| `decisions-log.md`    | Architectural decisions with rationale | `planning`, `brainstorming`    |


### Auto-Loading

Memory files are loaded on every session start via the session-start hook. They persist across conversations.

### Update Triggers

- `**/learn`** — Full project scan, populate all memory files
- **User correction** — Update `learned-patterns.md` or `user-preferences.md`
- **Architectural decision** — Update `decisions-log.md`
- **New discovery** — Update `project-context.md`

### Decay Rules

- Review memory files periodically for outdated information
- Remove patterns that no longer match the codebase
- Update tech stack info when dependencies change
- Decisions log is append-only (historical record)

## 7 ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY

### Error Classification


| Type          | Example                       | Strategy                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Transient** | Network timeout, rate limit   | Retry with backoff              |
| **Permanent** | Missing dependency, wrong API | Change approach                 |
| **Unknown**   | Unexpected error format       | Investigate, classify, then act |


### Retry Strategy (resilient-execution)

**[HARD-GATE:RETRY]** Try at least 3 different approaches before escalating:

1. **Approach 1:** Direct solution (most obvious fix)
2. **Approach 2:** Alternative method (different technique)
3. **Approach 3:** Workaround (solve the underlying problem differently)
4. **Escalate:** Report with full context — what was tried, what failed, why

### Circuit Breaker Recovery

When circuit opens:

1. Regenerate plan (fresh PLANNING iteration)
2. Change approach (try alternative strategy)
3. Reduce scope (break stuck task into subtasks)
4. Escalate (report blockage for human review)

### File Protection During Cleanup

Before any destructive operation (`rm`, `git clean`, `git checkout .`):

1. Check if operation targets protected files
2. If yes: ABORT and report
3. If no: Proceed with caution
4. After operation: Verify protected files still exist

## 8 SUBAGENT DISPATCH RULES

### How to Dispatch Subagents

All subagent dispatch uses the **`Agent` tool**. To run multiple agents in parallel, invoke multiple `Agent` tool calls in a **single message**.

**Key parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | Detailed task description with all necessary context |
| `description` | Short label (3-5 words) |
| `subagent_type` | `"Explore"` (fast codebase search), `"Plan"` (architecture), `"general-purpose"` (default) |
| `run_in_background` | `true` for async — you'll be notified on completion |
| `model` | Optional override: `"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, `"haiku"` |

### When to Dispatch vs Do Inline


| Scenario                                  | Action                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2+ independent tasks with no shared state | `Agent` tool — multiple parallel calls in one message |
| Single focused task                       | Do inline                       |
| Heavy reading/searching across codebase   | `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="Explore"` |
| Build or test execution                   | `Agent` tool — 1 at a time only |
| Code review                               | `Agent` tool dispatching `code-reviewer` agent |
| Quality evaluation                        | `Agent` tool dispatching `acceptance-judge` agent |


### Parallelism Limits


| Operation              | Max Parallel | Rationale                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| File reading/searching | 500          | I/O bound, safe to parallelize    |
| Spec auditing/updating | 100          | Independent file operations       |
| Building/testing       | 1            | Must serialize to detect failures |
| Code review            | 1            | Needs holistic view of changes    |


### Two-Stage Review Gates (subagent-driven-development)

1. **Stage 1: Spec Review** — Does implementation match specification?
2. **Stage 2: Quality Review** — Does code meet quality standards?

Both gates must pass before task is marked complete.

### Result Aggregation

When parallel `Agent` tool calls return:

1. Collect all results
2. Check for conflicts or contradictions
3. Synthesize into unified view
4. Report any disagreements for human review

## 9 GIT & BRANCH PROTOCOLS

### Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, chore, style, perf, ci, build
```

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow`
- `fix(api): handle null response from payment gateway`
- `test(user): add acceptance tests for registration`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Ralph-Friendly Work Branches

Scope autonomous work to feature branches:

```
git checkout -b ralph/<scope>
```

Each branch gets its own `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. Only tasks for that scope are included.

### Branch Completion

Use `finishing-a-development-branch` skill for structured options:

- Merge to main/develop
- Create pull request
- Cleanup and archive

### Safety Rules

- **Never** skip hooks (`--no-verify`)
- **Never** force-push without explicit user confirmation
- **Never** amend published commits without confirmation
- **Always** use conventional commit format
- **Always** include rationale in commit messages

## 10 ANTI-PATTERNS & RATIONALIZATION PREVENTION

These thoughts mean STOP — you are rationalizing:


| Red-Flag Thought                            | Correct Response                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This is just a simple question"            | Questions are tasks. Check for skills.                                        |
| "I need more context first"                 | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions.                                |
| "Let me explore the codebase first"         | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first.                                  |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill"          | If a skill exists, use it. No exceptions.                                     |
| "I remember this skill"                     | Skills evolve. Read current version via Skill tool.                           |
| "The skill is overkill"                     | Simple things become complex. Use it.                                         |
| "I'll just do this one thing first"         | Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.                                       |
| "Tests aren't needed for this"              | [HARD-GATE:TDD] TDD is not optional. Write the test first.                    |
| "I'll review later"                         | [HARD-GATE:REVIEW] Review NOW. No merge without review.                       |
| "I can skip verification"                   | [HARD-GATE:VERIFY] Verification is mandatory.                                 |
| "The loop is stuck, let me skip ahead"      | Circuit breaker protocol. Don't skip — diagnose.                              |
| "The spec is obvious, I'll skip writing it" | [HARD-GATE:SPEC] Write it. JTBD methodology.                                  |
| "I can eyeball the quality"                 | Use deterministic tests or LLM-as-judge. Never eyeball.                       |
| "Let me just push this quick fix"           | Plan → TDD → Review → Verify. Even for "quick" fixes.                         |
| "The acceptance criteria are implicit"      | Make them explicit. Given/When/Then. Always.                                  |
| "I'll add tests after"                      | RED comes before GREEN. Tests first. Always.                                  |
| "This refactor doesn't need tests"          | If behavior changes, tests change. If it doesn't, existing tests protect you. |

## 11 FIND-SKILLS INTEGRATION

When toolkit skills don't cover a specific need:

### Discovery

```bash
npx skills find [query]       # Search the skills ecosystem

## 12 DOCUMENTATION INDEX

Key project documents maintained by toolkit skills. These files are the authoritative sources — always reference them by path rather than duplicating content.

### Core Index

| Document | Maintained By | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/global/index.md` | `archive` skill | Global spec index — completed features, domain spec groupings |

### Technical Documentation

Documents generated by `tech-docs-generator` skill. After generation, add a row below:

| Document | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _example_ `docs/api-reference.md` | _API Reference_ | _Public API surface with signatures and examples_ |

### Usage Rule

When exploring a project, check this index first. If a document listed here exists on disk, read it — do NOT re-analyze code that is already documented. When generating new docs via `tech-docs-generator`, always update the `## Technical Documentation` table above. When archiving features via `archive`, ensure `docs/global/index.md` is referenced in `## Core Index` above.
