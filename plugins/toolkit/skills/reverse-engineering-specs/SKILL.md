# Reverse Engineering Specifications

## Overview

For brownfield/legacy projects without documentation, this skill generates implementation-free specifications by exhaustively analyzing existing code. The output is a complete behavioral description that drives autonomous development on top of the existing codebase — enabling safe refactoring, feature addition, and modernization.

**Key principle:** Document actual behavior, including bugs. Bugs are "documented features" until explicitly marked for fixing.

**This is a RIGID skill.** Every code path must be traced. No assumptions, no skipping.

## Phase 1: Exhaustive Code Investigation

**[HARD-GATE]** Every code path must be traced. No assumptions, no skipping.

Deploy parallel subagents via the `Agent` tool (up to 5, with `subagent_type="Explore"`) to analyze:

| Analysis Target   | What to Document                                             | Priority |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Entry points      | All ways the system can be invoked (HTTP, CLI, events, cron) | P0       |
| Code paths        | Every branch, loop, conditional, early return                | P0       |
| Data flows        | Input → transformation → output for every pipeline           | P0       |
| State mutations   | Every place state is read, written, or deleted               | P0       |
| Error handling    | Try/catch blocks, error codes, fallback behaviors            | P0       |
| Side effects      | External calls, file I/O, database writes, event emissions   | P1       |
| Configuration     | Environment variables, config files, feature flags           | P1       |
| Dependencies      | External services, libraries, APIs consumed                  | P1       |
| Concurrency       | Async operations, race conditions, locking mechanisms        | P2       |
| Implicit behavior | Convention-based routing, middleware chains, decorators      | P2       |

### Investigation Strategy Decision Table

| Codebase Size         | Strategy                           | Subagent Count |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Small (<50 files)     | Single-pass full scan              | 2              |
| Medium (50-500 files) | Module-by-module scan              | 3              |
| Large (500+ files)    | Entry-point-first, then depth scan | 5              |

STOP after investigation — present a summary of discovered entry points, data flows, and behaviors. Get confirmation before generating specs.

## Phase 2: Behavioral Specification Generation

Transform code analysis into implementation-free specs following the `spec-writing` skill format.

### Transformation Rules

| Rule                                     | Explanation                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strip ALL implementation details         | No function names, variable names, technology references |
| Describe WHAT, never HOW                 | Observable behavior only                                 |
| Document actual behavior (bugs included) | Bugs become "current behavior" in specs                  |
| Use Given/When/Then format               | For all acceptance criteria                              |
| Include data contracts                   | Input shapes, output shapes, invariants                  |
| Separate known issues                    | Bugs go in KNOWN_ISSUES.md, not inline                   |

### Implementation Detail Stripping

| Code Artifact                | What You See              | What You Write in Spec                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jwt.verify(token, secret)`  | Token validation with JWT | "Credentials are validated against the authentication system" |
| `redis.get(cacheKey)`        | Redis cache lookup        | "Previously computed results are retrieved from cache"        |
| `if (user.role === 'admin')` | Role check                | "Privileged operations require administrator access"          |
| `res.status(429).json(...)`  | Rate limiting response    | "Excessive requests receive a rate limit error"               |
| `bcrypt.hash(pw, 12)`        | Password hashing          | "Passwords are stored in a non-reversible format"             |

STOP after spec generation — run the completeness checklist before organizing.

## Phase 3: Specification Organization

Create spec files following the naming convention:

```
docs/changes/<date>_<topic>/specs/
├── 01-[first-capability].md
├── 02-[second-capability].md
├── ...
├── NN-[last-capability].md
└── KNOWN_ISSUES.md
```

### KNOWN_ISSUES.md Format

```markdown
# Known Issues

## [Issue Title]

- **Current behavior:** [What actually happens]
- **Expected behavior:** [What should happen, if known]
- **Affected specs:** [Which spec files reference this behavior]
- **Severity:** [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
- **Notes:** [Additional context]
```

### Severity Classification

| Severity     | Criteria                                        | Action                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Data loss, security vulnerability, system crash | Fix before any new features |
| **High**     | Incorrect results, broken workflow              | Fix in next release         |
| **Medium**   | Poor UX, performance issue                      | Plan for future fix         |
| **Low**      | Cosmetic, minor inconsistency                   | Fix opportunistically       |

STOP after organization — present the spec file list and KNOWN_ISSUES for review.

## Phase 4: Quality Verification

**[HARD-GATE]** All checks must pass before this phase is complete.

| #   | Check               | Question                                         | Status |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 1   | Entry points        | Are ALL entry points documented?                 | [ ]    |
| 2   | Code paths          | Are ALL branches and conditionals traced?        | [ ]    |
| 3   | Data flows          | Are ALL input→output pipelines described?        | [ ]    |
| 4   | State mutations     | Are ALL state changes captured?                  | [ ]    |
| 5   | Error handling      | Are ALL error paths documented?                  | [ ]    |
| 6   | Side effects        | Are ALL external interactions noted?             | [ ]    |
| 7   | Edge cases          | Are boundary conditions described?               | [ ]    |
| 8   | Concurrency         | Are async behaviors documented?                  | [ ]    |
| 9   | Configuration       | Are ALL config options listed?                   | [ ]    |
| 10  | Dependencies        | Are ALL external dependencies identified?        | [ ]    |
| 11  | Implementation-free | Zero code, tech names, or architecture in specs? | [ ]    |
| 12  | Given/When/Then     | All acceptance criteria in correct format?       | [ ]    |

## Concrete Example: Code to Spec Transformation

### Code (input — what you analyze):

```javascript
function checkAuth(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token' });
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (e) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
}
```

### Spec (output — what you produce):

```markdown
# Request Authentication

## Job to Be Done

When a request arrives at a protected endpoint, I want to verify the
caller's identity, so I can ensure only authorized users access the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Valid Credentials

- Given a request with valid credentials in the authorization header
- When the request is processed
- Then the request proceeds to the next handler
- And the authenticated user identity is available to downstream handlers

### Missing Credentials

- Given a request without credentials
- When the request is processed
- Then a 401 status is returned
- And an error message indicates missing credentials

### Invalid Credentials

- Given a request with invalid or expired credentials
- When the request is processed
- Then a 403 status is returned
- And an error message indicates invalid credentials

## Edge Cases

- Malformed authorization header (missing "Bearer" prefix): treated as missing credentials
- Expired credentials: treated as invalid credentials

## Data Contracts

- Input: Authorization header in "Bearer <credential>" format
- Output on success: User identity object attached to request context
- Output on failure: JSON error response with appropriate status code
```

Notice: No mention of JWT, middleware, Express, environment variables, or any implementation detail.

## Anti-Patterns / Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                   | Why It Is Wrong                                      | What To Do Instead                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Skipping "boring" code paths              | Undocumented behavior causes bugs during refactoring | Trace EVERY path, even error handlers      |
| Leaking implementation details into specs | Defeats the purpose of behavioral specs              | Strip all tech names, function names, code |
| Marking bugs as "correct behavior"        | Loses the information that it is a bug               | Document in KNOWN_ISSUES.md with severity  |
| Skipping async/concurrency analysis       | Race conditions are the hardest bugs to find         | Document all async behavior                |
| Analyzing only happy paths                | Most bugs live in error paths                        | Document ALL error handling paths          |
| Guessing behavior instead of tracing code | Spec becomes fiction                                 | Read every line — no assumptions           |
| Generating specs without user review      | Misunderstandings propagate                          | Present for review after each phase        |

## Anti-Rationalization Guards

- **[HARD-GATE]** Do NOT skip any code path — every branch, conditional, and error handler must be traced
- **[HARD-GATE]** Do NOT include ANY implementation details in specs — no code, tech names, or architecture
- **[HARD-GATE]** Do NOT mark the completeness checklist as done until ALL 12 items pass
- **Do NOT skip** concurrency analysis — even if the code "looks synchronous"
- **Do NOT skip** configuration analysis — env vars and feature flags change behavior
- **Do NOT** assume behavior from function names — read the actual code
- **Do NOT** fix bugs while reverse-engineering — document them in KNOWN_ISSUES.md

## Integration Points

| Skill                  | Relationship                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spec-writing`         | Output follows spec-writing format; use for audit after generation |
| `autonomous-loop`      | Specs feed into planning mode for gap analysis                     |
| `acceptance-testing`   | Tests derived from reverse-engineered acceptance criteria          |
| `self-learning`        | Populate memory files with discovered project context              |
| `planning`             | After specs exist, plan improvements or new features               |
| `systematic-debugging` | Known issues inform debugging priorities                           |

## Workflow After Reverse Engineering

| Step | Skill                              | Purpose                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `reverse-engineering-specs` (this) | Generate behavioral specs from code             |
| 2    | `spec-writing` (audit mode)        | Verify quality and completeness                 |
| 3    | `planning`                         | Identify gaps, plan improvements                |
| 4    | `autonomous-loop`                  | Implement features or fixes with specs as guide |

## Verification Gate

Before claiming reverse engineering is complete:

1. VERIFY the completeness checklist (all 12 items) passes
2. VERIFY zero implementation details in any spec file
3. VERIFY all acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format
4. VERIFY KNOWN_ISSUES.md exists and categorizes all discovered bugs
5. VERIFY the user has reviewed the spec set and KNOWN_ISSUES

## Skill Type

**Flexible** — Adapt investigation depth and subagent count to codebase size while preserving the exhaustive-investigation and implementation-free output rules. No code paths may be skipped.
