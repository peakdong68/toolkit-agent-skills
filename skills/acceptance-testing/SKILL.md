# Acceptance Testing

## Overview

Acceptance-driven backpressure connects specification acceptance criteria directly to test requirements, creating a validation chain that prevents premature completion claims. The system cannot cheat — you cannot claim a feature is done unless tests derived from spec acceptance criteria actually pass.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the acceptance-testing skill to validate against specification criteria."

## The Backpressure Chain

```
+------------+     derives      +------------+     validates    +------------+
|   SPECS    |---------------->|   TESTS    |---------------->|   CODE     |
|            |                  |            |                  |            |
| Acceptance |                  | Test cases |                  | Must pass  |
| Criteria   |                  | from AC    |                  | all tests  |
+------------+                  +------------+                  +------------+
      ^                                                              |
      |                    backpressure                               |
      +--------------------------------------------------------------+
      If tests fail, implementation must change (not the spec or test)
```

## Phase 1: Extract Acceptance Criteria

**Goal:** From each specification file, extract all Given/When/Then acceptance criteria.

### Actions

1. Locate all specification files (`docs/changes/<date>_<topic>/specs/*.md`)
2. Extract every acceptance criterion with its ID
3. Document in structured format

### Example Extraction

```markdown
## From spec: 01-color-extraction.md

### AC-1: Extract dominant colors

- Given an uploaded image (PNG, JPG, or WebP)
- When color extraction is triggered
- Then 5-10 dominant colors are returned
- And each color includes hex, RGB, and HSL representations

### AC-2: Handle invalid images

- Given a corrupted or unsupported file
- When color extraction is attempted
- Then an appropriate error is returned
- And no partial results are produced
```

### STOP — HARD-GATE: Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until:

- [ ] All spec files are located and read
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion is extracted with an ID
- [ ] Criteria are in Given/When/Then format
- [ ] No criteria are ambiguous (if ambiguous, clarify with spec author)

---

## Phase 2: Derive Test Cases

**Goal:** Map every acceptance criterion to at least one test case.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HARD-GATE: Every acceptance criterion must have at least one   │
│  corresponding test. No exceptions. If a criterion has no       │
│  test, the feature is NOT complete.                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Traceability Table

| Acceptance Criterion          | Test Type   | Test Description                                            | Test File:Line        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| AC-1: Extract dominant colors | Integration | Upload valid image, verify 5-10 colors with hex/RGB/HSL     | test/color.test.js:15 |
| AC-2: Handle invalid images   | Integration | Upload corrupted file, verify error, verify no partial data | test/color.test.js:42 |

### Decision Table: Test Type for Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion Type             | Test Type                   | Rationale                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Data input/output behavior | Integration                 | Tests real data flow                     |
| Error handling behavior    | Integration                 | Tests error paths end-to-end             |
| Performance requirement    | Load test                   | Requires measurement under load          |
| UI behavior                | E2E (Playwright)            | Tests real browser interaction           |
| Subjective quality         | LLM-as-judge                | Cannot be deterministically tested       |
| Security requirement       | Integration + security test | Tests authorization and input validation |

### STOP — HARD-GATE: Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until:

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion has at least one test mapped
- [ ] Test types are appropriate for the criterion type
- [ ] Test file locations are identified

---

## Phase 3: Write Tests Before Implementation

**Goal:** Write acceptance tests that will fail until the feature is correctly implemented.

### Actions

This phase integrates with `test-driven-development`:

1. Write test from acceptance criterion (RED)
2. Implement feature to pass test (GREEN)
3. Refactor while keeping test green (REFACTOR)

### Behavioral Outcome Focus

| Verify This (Behavioral)         | NOT This (Implementation)       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| "5-10 colors are returned"       | "K-means runs with k=8"         |
| "Response time < 200ms"          | "Cache is hit on second call"   |
| "Error message is user-friendly" | "CustomError class is thrown"   |
| "Data persists across sessions"  | "PostgreSQL INSERT executes"    |
| "UI updates within 500ms"        | "WebSocket message is received" |

### STOP — HARD-GATE: Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 until:

- [ ] All acceptance tests are written
- [ ] Tests fail before implementation (RED confirmed)
- [ ] Tests verify behavioral outcomes, not implementation details

---

## Phase 4: Validation Gates

**Goal:** Before claiming any task complete, ALL gates must pass.

| Gate              | Check                     | Tool         | Required        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Unit tests        | All pass                  | Test runner  | Always          |
| Integration tests | All pass                  | Test runner  | Always          |
| Acceptance tests  | All AC-derived tests pass | Test runner  | Always          |
| Build             | Compiles without errors   | Build tool   | Always          |
| Lint              | No violations             | Linter       | Always          |
| Typecheck         | No type errors            | Type checker | When applicable |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HARD-GATE: ACCEPTANCE                                         │
│                                                                 │
│  Cannot claim completion without ALL acceptance tests passing.  │
│  If any acceptance test fails, the feature is NOT done.        │
│  Fix the implementation, not the spec or the test.             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### STOP — HARD-GATE: Do NOT proceed to Phase 5 until:

- [ ] All validation gates pass
- [ ] Acceptance tests pass with green status
- [ ] No gates are skipped or marked as "will fix later"

---

## Phase 5: Traceability Report

**Goal:** Produce a report linking every spec criterion to its test and result.

### Report Template

```markdown
## Acceptance Test Report

| Spec                    | Criterion                     | Test                   | Status |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| 01-color-extraction.md  | AC-1: Extract dominant colors | test/color.test.js:15  | PASS   |
| 01-color-extraction.md  | AC-2: Handle invalid images   | test/color.test.js:42  | PASS   |
| 02-palette-rendering.md | AC-1: Render palette grid     | test/palette.test.js:8 | PASS   |

### Summary

- Total criteria: N
- Tested: N
- Passing: N
- Failing: 0
- Coverage: 100%
```

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Changing specs to match implementation         | Defeats the purpose of specification | Fix the implementation, not the spec               |
| Skipping edge case criteria                    | Edge cases cause production bugs     | ALL acceptance criteria get tests                  |
| Testing implementation details                 | Brittle tests that break on refactor | Test observable behavioral outcomes                |
| Claiming "tests pass" without acceptance tests | Unit tests alone are insufficient    | Acceptance tests are a separate, required category |
| Writing acceptance tests after implementation  | Tests shaped to pass, not to specify | Write BEFORE implementation (TDD)                  |
| Deferring acceptance tests to "later"          | Later never comes                    | Write them in Phase 2, before coding               |
| Marking failing tests as "known issues"        | Hides incomplete implementation      | Fix the code until tests pass                      |

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse                                          | Reality                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "The unit tests cover this"                     | Unit tests test components in isolation; acceptance tests verify integrated behavior |
| "The spec is obvious, no need for formal tests" | Obvious specs still need verifiable tests                                            |
| "We can manually verify this"                   | Manual verification is not repeatable or trustworthy                                 |
| "The acceptance criteria are too vague to test" | Clarify the criteria; vague specs produce vague code                                 |
| "This is just a cosmetic change"                | Cosmetic changes can break layout, accessibility, and UX                             |

## Skill Type

**RIGID** — The backpressure chain must not be bypassed. Every acceptance criterion must have a test. No completion without passing acceptance tests. Fix the implementation, not the spec or the test.
