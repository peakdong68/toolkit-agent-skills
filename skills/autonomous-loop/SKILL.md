description: 'Use when running Ralph-style iterative autonomous development. Triggers on  /goal  or  /ralph or  /loop  commands, when autonomous iterative development is needed, when a project has specs and an implementation plan ready for iterative execution, or when deterministic context loading with subagent delegation and dual-condition exit gates is required. Orchestrates PLANNING, BUILDING, and STATUS cycles.'

# Autonomous Loop

## Overview

The autonomous loop implements Ralph's iterative development methodology. Each iteration loads identical context (PROMPT + AGENTS files), executes one focused task, reports structured status, and persists state to disk for the next iteration. The loop continues until the dual-condition exit gate is satisfied. The core innovation is that deterministic conditions allow Claude to autonomously plan, build, and iterate toward quality without human intervention in the loop.

**Announce at start:** "I'm starting the autonomous loop. Loading context and beginning PLANNING mode."

## Trigger Conditions

- `/ralph` or `/loop` or `/goal` command invoked
- Project has specs and is ready for iterative autonomous development
- Multi-task implementation that benefits from autonomous iteration
- User requests autonomous execution without per-task approval

## Phase 1: PLANNING MODE (Gap Analysis)

**Goal:** Analyze specs against implementation to identify and prioritize remaining work.

<HARD-GATE>
Planning mode produces NO implementation code. It is analysis and planning ONLY.
</HARD-GATE>

### Steps

1. **Knowledge Gathering** — Deploy up to 5 parallel subagents via the `Agent` tool (with `subagent_type="Explore"` and `model="sonnet"`) to study specs, existing implementation plans, and utility libraries
2. **Code Analysis** — Deploy up to 5 parallel subagents via the `Agent` tool (with `subagent_type="Explore"`) to study `src/*` against `docs/specs/<date>_<topic>/*`, identifying gaps between specification and implementation
3. **Synthesis** — Deploy a synthesis subagent via the `Agent` tool (with `model="opus"`) to synthesize findings and prioritize incomplete work
4. **Plan Refresh** — Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as organized, prioritized bullet list

### Planning Mode Constraints

| Constraint                                        | Rationale                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Verify ALL assumptions through code search        | Never assume something is absent                   |
| Treat `src/lib` as authoritative standard library | Consolidate, do not duplicate                      |
| Output is a prioritized task list                 | Not code, not designs — tasks only                 |
| Identify missing specs                            | Specs gaps are blockers, not things to guess about |

### Planning Mode Output

```
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md updated:
- [x] Completed tasks (checked off)
- [ ] Remaining task 1 (highest priority)
- [ ] Remaining task 2
- [ ] Remaining task 3
...
Missing specs identified: [list or "none"]
```

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until:**

- [ ] All specs have been read and analyzed
- [ ] Code has been compared against specs
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is updated with prioritized tasks
- [ ] Missing specs are identified (if any)

---

## Phase 2: BUILDING MODE (Implementation)

**Goal:** Select and complete exactly ONE task per iteration.

### "ONE Task Per Loop" Principle

Each iteration selects and completes exactly one task from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. This reduces context switching, enables clear progress measurement, and makes debugging easier.

### Steps

1. **Study** — Read specs and current IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. **Select** — Choose the most important remaining task
3. **Search** — Find existing code patterns (do NOT assume implementations are missing)
4. **Implement** — Write complete, production-quality code (no placeholders, no stubs)
5. **Test** — Run tests immediately after implementation
6. **Update** — Refresh IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with findings and progress
7. **Commit** — Descriptive conventional commit message with rationale

### Task Selection Decision Table

| Condition                       | Which Task to Select               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Blocker exists for other tasks  | Select the blocker task            |
| Test failures exist             | Select task that fixes the failure |
| All tasks independent           | Select highest priority task       |
| Multiple tasks at same priority | Select the one with clearest spec  |
| Spec is missing for top task    | Run PLANNING mode to identify gap  |

### Subagent Rules During Building

| Resource              | Budget                  | Rationale                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Read/search subagents | Up to 5 parallel Sonnet | Fast context gathering                  |
| Build subagent        | Only 1 Sonnet at a time | Serialize builds to detect failures     |
| Main context          | 40-60% utilization      | The "smart zone" — enough room to think |

### Building Mode Constraints

| Constraint                   | Rationale                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| No placeholders or stubs     | Every line of code is production-quality |
| Search before implementing   | Code may already exist elsewhere         |
| Run tests immediately        | Backpressure catches errors early        |
| Update plan after every task | Keep plan current with reality           |
| Commit after every task      | Small atomic commits, easy to revert     |

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until:**

- [ ] Task is fully implemented (no stubs)
- [ ] Tests have been run
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is updated
- [ ] Changes are committed

---

## Phase 3: STATUS CHECK

**Goal:** Produce a RALPH_STATUS block and evaluate exit conditions.

After each BUILD iteration, invoke the `ralph-status` skill to produce a structured status block.

### Exit Evaluation

| Check                    | Condition                                  | Result            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Tasks remaining?         | IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md has unchecked items | Continue loop     |
| Tests passing?           | Full test suite passes                     | Required for exit |
| Errors in iteration?     | Clean execution, no unresolved exceptions  | Required for exit |
| Meaningful work remains? | No TODOs, no incomplete features           | Required for exit |

### Loop Decision

| Status      | Tasks Remaining | Tests   | Action                         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| IN_PROGRESS | Yes             | Any     | Loop back to Phase 1 or 2      |
| IN_PROGRESS | No              | FAILING | Loop — fix failures first      |
| BLOCKED     | Any             | Any     | Report blocker, wait for input |
| COMPLETE    | No              | PASSING | Evaluate exit gate             |

---

## Exit Conditions — Dual-Condition Gate

<HARD-GATE>
Both conditions must be true simultaneously to exit the loop:
</HARD-GATE>

| Condition             | Threshold                                  | Verification                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Completion indicators | >= 2 recent occurrences of "done" language | Heuristic detection in output |
| Explicit EXIT_SIGNAL  | `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` in status block        | Intentional declaration       |

### EXIT_SIGNAL May Only Be `true` When ALL Of:

- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md has no remaining tasks
- All tests pass
- No errors in latest iteration
- No meaningful work remains

This prevents false positives where completion language appears while productive work continues.

### Exit Decision Table

| Completion Language | EXIT_SIGNAL | Action                             |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| < 2 occurrences     | false       | Continue loop                      |
| >= 2 occurrences    | false       | Continue — may be casual language  |
| < 2 occurrences     | true        | Continue — signal without evidence |
| >= 2 occurrences    | true        | EXIT the loop                      |

## Context Efficiency

| Resource        | Budget             | Strategy                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Main context    | 40-60% of window   | Keep focused; delegate heavy lifting      |
| Read subagents  | Up to 5 parallel   | Searching, file reading, pattern matching |
| Build subagents | 1 at a time        | Implementation, test execution            |
| Token format    | Markdown over JSON | ~30% more efficient                       |

## Steering Mechanisms

### Upstream Steering (Shaping Inputs)

| Mechanism                              | Purpose                          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| First ~5,000 tokens for detailed specs | Front-load specification context |
| Identical files each iteration         | Deterministic context loading    |
| Existing code patterns as guides       | Generate consistent code         |

### Downstream Steering (Validation Gates)

| Gate         | What It Catches           |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Tests        | Invalid implementations   |
| Builds       | Compilation errors        |
| Linters      | Style inconsistencies     |
| Typecheckers | Contract violations       |
| LLM-as-judge | Subjective quality issues |

---

## State Persistence

The only persistent state between iterations is the file system:

| File                             | Purpose                         | Managed By                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`         | Task list and progress          | Planning and Building modes |
| `docs/specs/<date>_<topic>/*.md` | Specification files             | `spec-writing` skill        |
| `AGENTS.md`                      | Operational notes and learnings | Building mode               |
| Source code + tests              | The actual implementation       | Building mode               |

**IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is disposable** — it can be regenerated from specs at any time by running a planning iteration.

## Anti-Patterns / Common Mistakes

| Anti-Pattern                        | Why It Fails                              | Correct Approach                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Multiple tasks per iteration        | Context switching, unclear progress       | ONE task per loop                        |
| Assuming code is missing            | May exist elsewhere, leads to duplication | Always search first                      |
| Skipping tests after implementation | Bugs accumulate, no backpressure          | Run tests IMMEDIATELY                    |
| Modifying plan only during planning | Plan drifts from reality                  | Update during BOTH planning and building |
| Keeping stale plans                 | Tasks based on outdated assumptions       | Regenerate liberally — planning is cheap |
| Manual context management           | Main context overflows                    | Trust subagent delegation                |
| Exiting without dual-condition      | Premature exit, work incomplete           | Both conditions must be true             |
| Not committing after each task      | Large changesets, hard to revert          | Commit every iteration                   |
| Placeholder or stub code            | Incomplete implementations accumulate     | Production-quality code only             |
| Skipping STATUS CHECK               | No exit evaluation, loop runs forever     | Every iteration ends with status         |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Guards

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT exit the loop without the dual-condition gate passing. Do NOT implement more than one task per iteration. Do NOT write placeholder or stub code. Do NOT skip the STATUS CHECK.
</HARD-GATE>

If you catch yourself thinking:

- "I can do two quick tasks in this iteration..." — No. ONE task per loop.
- "The plan is probably fine, skip planning mode..." — Verify. Plans drift.
- "Tests can wait until the next iteration..." — Run tests NOW. Backpressure is essential.
- "Everything is done, I can exit..." — Check the dual-condition gate. Both must be true.

---

## Subagent Dispatch Opportunities

| Task Pattern                           | Dispatch To                                    | When                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Independent file reads across codebase | `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="Explore"`    | When loop iteration needs context from multiple areas    |
| Test execution during build phase      | `Bash` tool with `run_in_background=true`      | When tests can validate work without blocking progress   |
| Code review between iterations         | `Agent` tool dispatching `code-reviewer` agent | After completing a build iteration, before next planning |

Follow the `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill protocol when dispatching.

## Concrete Examples

### Example: Planning Mode Output

```
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Implement core data types
- [ ] Implement user authentication (P0 — blocks 3 other tasks)
- [ ] Add API rate limiting (P1)
- [ ] Implement webhook handlers (P1)
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging (P2)

Missing specs: Rate limiting spec needs error response format defined.
```

### Example: Building Mode Iteration

```
Task selected: Implement user authentication
Searched: Found existing password hashing in src/lib/crypto.ts
Implemented: src/auth/service.ts, src/auth/middleware.ts
Tests: 8 passing, 0 failing
Committed: feat(auth): implement JWT-based user authentication

Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
- [x] Implement user authentication
```

### Example: Status Block

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 1
FILES_MODIFIED: 4
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
RECOMMENDATION: Next: implement API rate limiting (P1)
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

---

## Skill Type

**RIGID** — Follow this process exactly. The determinism of the loop depends on consistent execution. ONE task per loop. Status block every iteration. Dual-condition exit gate. No exceptions.
