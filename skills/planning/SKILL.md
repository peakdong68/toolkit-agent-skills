description: 'Use when starting any implementation task, feature request, bug fix, or refactoring work. Triggers on /plan command, before any code is written, when requirements need structured analysis, or when transitioning from brainstorming to implementation. Forces question-asking, approach comparison, and explicit approval before any code.'

# Structured Planning

## Overview

Structured planning converts vague requirements into approved, documented implementation plans before any code is written. It forces clarifying questions, approach comparison with trade-offs, and explicit user approval — preventing the most common cause of wasted effort: building the wrong thing. Every task, regardless of perceived simplicity, goes through this process.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the planning skill to create a structured implementation plan."

## Trigger Conditions

- User requests a new feature, enhancement, or change
- A bug fix requires more than a one-line change
- Refactoring work spanning multiple files
- Any task where the approach is not already documented and approved
- Transition from brainstorming skill with an approved design
- `/plan` command invoked

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Understand the codebase and existing patterns before asking questions.

1. Read relevant files, docs, recent commits, and CLAUDE.md
2. Check memory files for known project context, stack, and conventions
3. **Check for existing specs in `docs/specs/`** — if a spec file exists for this feature, load its acceptance criteria, data contracts, and edge cases; these become the authoritative source for task definition in Phase 4
4. Review existing plans in `docs/plans/` for related or dependent work
5. Identify existing patterns the new work should follow
6. Note technical constraints discovered during exploration

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until:**

- [ ] You have explored the relevant parts of the codebase
- [ ] You understand the existing architecture and patterns
- [ ] You have checked memory files for prior decisions
- [ ] You have loaded any relevant specs from `docs/specs/` and extracted their acceptance criteria

---

## Phase 2: Clarifying Questions

**Goal:** Eliminate ambiguity by asking targeted questions one at a time.

1. Ask ONE question per message — never overwhelm with multiple questions
2. Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
3. Study the codebase before asking — do not ask what you can discover
4. Convert vague requirements into specific, testable criteria

### Question Category Priority

| Priority | Category          | Example Question                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Purpose           | "What problem does this solve? Who is it for?"                         |
| 2        | Success criteria  | "How will we know it works? What does 'done' look like?"               |
| 3        | Constraints       | "Are there performance, compatibility, or timeline constraints?"       |
| 4        | Non-goals         | "What should we explicitly NOT build?"                                 |
| 5        | Existing patterns | "Should we follow the pattern used in X, or is a new approach needed?" |
| 6        | Edge cases        | "What should happen when [boundary condition]?"                        |

### Question Rules

| Rule                      | Rationale                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| One question per message  | Prevents cognitive overload                 |
| Multiple choice preferred | Faster to answer, reduces ambiguity         |
| Research before asking    | Respect user's time — discover what you can |
| Testable criteria         | Vague answers lead to vague implementations |

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until:**

- [ ] You understand the purpose and success criteria
- [ ] You have identified constraints and non-goals
- [ ] No critical ambiguities remain

---

## Phase 3: Approach Design

**Goal:** Propose 2-3 concrete approaches with trade-offs and a clear recommendation.

For each approach, include:

| Section              | Content                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Architecture summary | 2-3 sentences describing the approach |
| Key files            | Exact paths to create/modify          |
| Dependencies         | External deps or breaking changes     |
| Trade-offs           | Explicit pros and cons                |
| Effort estimate      | Number of tasks (not hours)           |
| Risk level           | Low / Medium / High with explanation  |

### Approach Selection Decision Table

| Factor                           | Weight | How to Evaluate                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Alignment with existing patterns | High   | Does it match current codebase conventions?    |
| Simplicity                       | High   | Fewest moving parts that meet requirements     |
| Testability                      | Medium | Can each component be independently tested?    |
| Future extensibility             | Low    | Only consider if user mentioned future plans   |
| Performance                      | Varies | Only if user specified performance constraints |

**Lead with your recommended approach.** Explain why it is the best choice given the constraints. Present alternatives to show you considered the trade-off space.

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 until:**

- [ ] You have proposed at least 2 approaches
- [ ] Each approach has trade-offs documented
- [ ] You have made a clear recommendation with reasoning

---

## Phase 4: Plan Documentation

**Goal:** Write a detailed, executable plan document and get explicit approval.

### Plan Document Format

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence]
**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences]
**Approach:** [Which approach was chosen and why]
**Spec Reference:** [Path to spec file, e.g., `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/`]

---

### Task N: [Component Name]

**Spec AC:** [Which acceptance criteria from the spec this task satisfies]

**Files:**

- Create: `exact/path/to/file.ext`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ext`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.ext`

**Steps:**

1. Write the failing test (aligned to spec acceptance criteria above)
2. Run test to verify it fails
3. Write minimal implementation
4. Run test to verify it passes
5. Commit

**Verification:** [Exact command to verify this task]
```

### Plan Quality Checklist

| Criterion                               | Check                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Every task has exact file paths         | No "somewhere in src/"                |
| Every task has a verification command   | No "eyeball it"                       |
| Tasks reference spec AC when applicable | No orphan tasks without a spec anchor |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency         | No forward references                 |
| Tasks are 2-5 minutes each              | No "implement the whole module"       |
| TDD steps are explicit                  | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR per task           |

Save the plan to `docs/plans/<date>_<topic>/plan.md`.

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 5 until:**

- [ ] Plan document is written and saved
- [ ] Every task has file paths, steps, and verification
- [ ] User has explicitly approved the plan (said "yes", "approved", "go ahead", etc.)

---

## Phase 5: Transition to Execution

**Goal:** Hand off the approved plan to the appropriate execution skill.

### Step 1: Consider Worktree Isolation

Before executing, evaluate whether the plan would benefit from an isolated git worktree:

| Condition                                                     | Recommendation          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Multi-task plan that may conflict with current working branch | Create worktree         |
| Need to run long processes (tests, builds) while continuing   | Create worktree         |
| Working on parallel tasks/branches simultaneously             | Create worktree         |
| Single isolated task, no other work in progress               | Skip — use current repo |

If a worktree is appropriate, invoke `using-git-worktrees` skill and navigate to the created worktree before proceeding. Worktree creation is typically the first step of plan execution.

### Step 2: Select Execution Skill

| Situation                                    | Next Skill                    | Rationale                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Standard implementation (< 10 tasks)         | `task-management`             | Sequential tracked execution         |
| Large implementation (10+ independent tasks) | `subagent-driven-development` | Parallel execution with review gates |
| Autonomous development session               | `autonomous-loop`             | Ralph-style iterative execution      |
| Single focused task                          | `executing-plans`             | Direct plan execution                |

Invoke the chosen skill and pass the plan document path.

## Anti-Patterns / Common Mistakes

| Anti-Pattern                  | Why It Fails                                     | Correct Approach                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| "This is too simple to plan"  | Simple tasks have unexamined assumptions         | Plan anyway — the plan can be short |
| "I already know the approach" | Your approach may conflict with project patterns | Document it and get approval        |
| "The user wants it fast"      | Bad code is slower than planned code             | Planning prevents rework            |
| "It's just a bug fix"         | Bug fixes need root cause analysis               | Plan the fix, not just the patch    |
| "I'll plan as I go"           | That is improvising, not planning                | Plan first, execute second          |
| Asking 5 questions at once    | Overwhelms the user, gets vague answers          | One question per message            |
| Proposing only 1 approach     | No trade-off analysis, may miss better options   | Always propose 2-3 approaches       |
| Vague file references         | "Update the tests" — which tests?                | Exact file paths always             |
| Tasks that take 30+ minutes   | Too large to track and verify                    | Break into 2-5 minute tasks         |
| Starting code before approval | Wastes effort if direction changes               | Wait for explicit "yes"             |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Guards

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write any code, create any files, or take any implementation action until:
1. You have asked clarifying questions and understood the requirements
2. You have proposed approaches with trade-offs
3. The user has explicitly approved the plan

This applies to EVERY task regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

**Iron Law: NO CODE WITHOUT AN APPROVED PLAN.** No exceptions. No "just this small thing." No "it's obvious."

If you catch yourself thinking any of the following, STOP immediately:

- "Let me just quickly..." — No. Plan first.
- "This doesn't need a full plan..." — Yes it does. The plan can be brief.
- "I'll document it after..." — No. Document before.

## Subagent Dispatch Opportunities

| Task Pattern                                          | Dispatch To                                                               | When                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Independent research tasks during planning            | `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="Explore"`                               | When gathering context from multiple codebase areas |
| Plan validation across architecture layers            | `Agent` tool dispatching `planner` agent                                  | When plan covers multiple system boundaries         |
| After plan approval, independent implementation tasks | `Agent` tool (multiple parallel, per `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill) | When plan steps have no dependencies between them   |

Follow the `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill protocol when dispatching.

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorming`                  | Upstream — provides design context                          | Planning follows brainstorming                 |
| `spec-writing`                   | Upstream — provides acceptance criteria for task definition | When specs exist for the feature being planned |
| `task-management`                | Downstream — receives approved plan                         | Standard execution path                        |
| `executing-plans`                | Downstream — executes plan directly                         | Single-task execution                          |
| `subagent-driven-development`    | Downstream — parallel execution                             | Large independent task sets                    |

| `using-git-worktrees`            | Downstream — creates isolated development environment       | Before executing multi-task plans              |
| `code-review`                    | Downstream — reviews implementation against plan            | After plan execution completes                 |
| `acceptance-testing`             | Downstream — validates plan execution against acceptance criteria | After implementation against spec       |

## Concrete Examples

### Example: Small Bug Fix Plan

```markdown
# Fix: Login button disabled state not clearing

**Goal:** Fix login button remaining disabled after failed login attempt
**Architecture:** State management bug in LoginForm component
**Approach:** Reset `isSubmitting` state in the catch block of handleSubmit

### Task 1: Write failing test

**Files:** Test: `tests/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`
**Steps:** Write test that submits invalid credentials and verifies button re-enables
**Verification:** `npm test -- --grep "re-enables button after failed login"`

### Task 2: Fix the bug

**Files:** Modify: `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`
**Steps:** Add `setIsSubmitting(false)` to catch block in handleSubmit
**Verification:** `npm test -- --grep "LoginForm"` — all pass
```

### Example: Transition Command

After plan approval:

```
Plan approved and saved to docs/plans/2026-03-15_login-fix/plan.md.
Invoking task-management skill to begin tracked execution.
```

---

## Verification Gate

Before claiming the plan is complete, verify:

1. IDENTIFY: Plan document exists at `docs/plans/`
2. RUN: Review plan for completeness against quality checklist
3. READ: Verify all sections are filled with specific details
4. SPEC-CHECK: If a spec exists in `docs/specs/`, verify every task references at least one acceptance criterion
5. VERIFY: User has explicitly approved
6. CLAIM: Only then transition to implementation

---

## Key Principles

- **DRY** — Do not repeat yourself
- **YAGNI** — Do not build what is not needed yet
- **TDD** — Write tests first when applicable
- **Frequent commits** — Small, atomic commits after each task
- **Exact paths** — Always specify exact file paths in the plan

---

## Skill Type

**RIGID** — Follow this process exactly for every implementation task. The phases are sequential and non-negotiable. No code without an approved plan.
