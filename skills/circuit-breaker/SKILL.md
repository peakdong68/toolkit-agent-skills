description: 'Use when running autonomous loops, repeated operations, or when detecting stagnation patterns - enforces rate limits, protects configuration files, manages recovery with cooldown periods, and prevents infinite loops during autonomous development'
---

## Overview

The circuit-breaker skill is a safety mechanism that prevents infinite loops, resource exhaustion, and accidental destruction during autonomous development. It operates at the **loop level** (complementing `resilient-execution` which operates at the **task level**). Without circuit-breaker protection, autonomous loops can waste hours on stagnant problems, exhaust API limits, or accidentally destroy configuration files. This skill enforces hard boundaries that keep autonomous operations productive and safe.

**Announce at start:** "Circuit breaker is active — monitoring for stagnation, rate limits, and file protection."

## Phase 1: Circuit State Check

Before each loop iteration, check the current circuit state:

```
+-----------+     threshold     +-----------+     cooldown     +------------+
|  CLOSED   |----exceeded----->|   OPEN    |----elapsed------>| HALF-OPEN  |
|  (normal) |                  |  (halted) |                  |  (probe)   |
+-----------+                  +-----------+                  +-----+------+
     ^                                                              |
     |                          success                             |
     +--------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                          failure                             |
     |                    +-----------+                              |
     +--------------------+   OPEN    |<----------------------------+
                          +-----------+
```

| State         | Meaning                        | Action                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CLOSED**    | Normal operation               | Execute iteration, monitor all thresholds                    |
| **OPEN**      | Halted due to threshold breach | Report status, wait for cooldown, or escalate                |
| **HALF-OPEN** | Probing after cooldown         | Allow ONE iteration. If success: close. If failure: re-open. |

> **STOP: Check circuit state BEFORE executing any loop iteration. Do NOT execute if circuit is OPEN.**

---

## Phase 2: Stagnation Detection

Monitor these thresholds continuously during autonomous operation:

| Condition          | Threshold                                          | Detection Method                                   | Action                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| No progress        | 3 consecutive loops with zero meaningful changes   | Track files modified + tasks completed per loop    | OPEN circuit                         |
| Identical errors   | 5 consecutive loops producing the same error       | Compare error messages across iterations           | OPEN circuit                         |
| Output decline     | 70% decline in output volume across iterations     | Compare output line count across last 3 iterations | OPEN circuit                         |
| Permission denials | 3 consecutive tool permission failures             | Track permission errors                            | OPEN circuit                         |
| Test fix loop      | >80% of effort spent on test fixes only            | Track work type per iteration                      | OPEN circuit, investigate root cause |
| Circular approach  | Same 2-3 approaches alternating without resolution | Track approach history                             | OPEN circuit                         |

### Stagnation Scoring

Each iteration, compute a progress score:

| Indicator                                    | Score |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| New test passing that was previously failing | +3    |
| Task marked complete                         | +5    |
| File modified with meaningful changes        | +1    |
| Build/lint error resolved                    | +2    |
| Same error as previous iteration             | -2    |
| No files modified                            | -3    |
| Reverted previous changes                    | -1    |

**Threshold:** If cumulative score across 3 iterations is negative, OPEN the circuit.

> **STOP: If any threshold is breached, OPEN the circuit immediately. Do NOT attempt "one more try."**

---

## Phase 3: Recovery Protocol

When the circuit opens, follow this recovery sequence:

### Cooldown Period

- **Default:** 30 minutes before retry
- **Purpose:** Prevents rapid cycling through the same failing state
- **After cooldown:** Circuit enters HALF-OPEN state

### HALF-OPEN Behavior

1. Allow exactly ONE iteration to execute
2. If successful (positive progress score): Close circuit, resume normal operation
3. If failed (same stagnation pattern): Re-open circuit, double the cooldown timer

### Recovery Strategy Decision Table

| Stagnation Type                            | Strategy 1                          | Strategy 2                                 | Strategy 3                              | Strategy 4                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| No progress (stuck on same task)           | Regenerate plan with fresh analysis | Break stuck task into 3+ subtasks          | Skip to next task, return later         | Escalate to user               |
| Identical errors (same error repeating)    | Change approach entirely            | Check if error is environmental            | Search for known issue/workaround       | Escalate with error log        |
| Test fix loop (tests keep breaking)        | Review test assumptions             | Check if implementation approach is flawed | Simplify implementation scope           | Escalate with test analysis    |
| Circular approach (alternating same fixes) | Step back and re-analyze root cause | Try approach NOT yet attempted             | Reduce scope to minimal working version | Escalate with approach history |

> **STOP: After recovery, monitor the next 3 iterations closely. If stagnation recurs, escalate immediately.**

---

## Phase 4: Rate Limiting

Track and enforce API usage limits:

| Parameter          | Default          | Purpose                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| MAX_CALLS_PER_HOUR | 100              | Prevents API overuse               |
| Reset window       | Hourly (rolling) | Automatic counter reset            |
| Countdown display  | Active           | Shows remaining calls before limit |

### Rate Limit Behavior

1. Track API calls per rolling hour
2. At 80% of limit: display warning, prioritize remaining calls
3. At 100% of limit: pause execution, display countdown to reset
4. Never exceed limit — wait for reset window

### Three-Layer Timeout Detection

For long-running operations (especially API calls with extended limits):

| Layer              | Detection                       | Fallback                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Timeout guard   | Exit code 124 or timeout signal | Capture partial output, log what completed |
| 2. JSON validation | Parse response structure        | Attempt text extraction from raw response  |
| 3. Text fallback   | Raw output capture              | Log everything, report for human review    |

---

## Phase 5: File Protection

<HARD-GATE>
Configuration files must NEVER be deleted during autonomous operations. This is non-negotiable.
</HARD-GATE>

### Protected Paths

| Path                                     | Type      | Why Protected                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.ralph/`                                | Directory | Loop state and configuration                  |
| `.ralphrc`                               | File      | Ralph configuration                           |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`                 | File      | Current plan — source of truth for loop       |
| `AGENTS.md`                              | File      | Agent definitions                             |
| `docs/changes/<date>_<topic>/specs/*.md` | Directory | Specifications — source of truth for features |
| `.claude/`                               | Directory | Claude Code configuration                     |
| `CLAUDE.md`                              | File      | Agent operating manual                        |
| `memory/`                                | Directory | Persisted learnings across sessions           |

### Protection Mechanisms

| Mechanism             | How It Works                                                            | When It Triggers                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Allowlist enforcement | Only permitted tools can modify protected files                         | Before any file write to protected path    |
| Integrity validation  | Check protected files exist after each iteration                        | End of every loop iteration                |
| Pre-operation checks  | Verify protected files before destructive operations                    | Before `rm`, `git clean`, `git checkout .` |
| Restricted commands   | Block `git clean`, `git rm` on protected paths, `rm -rf` on config dirs | When command targets protected path        |

### Pre-Destructive Operation Checklist

Before any `rm`, `git clean`, or `git checkout .`:

1. List all files that will be affected
2. Check each against the protected paths list
3. If ANY protected file would be affected: ABORT and report
4. If safe: proceed with caution
5. After operation: verify all protected files still exist

> **STOP: If a protected file is missing after any operation, halt immediately and restore it.**

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Metrics

Track these metrics across loop iterations:

| Metric              | Purpose                   | Alert Threshold              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Loop count          | Total iterations executed | >20 for a single task        |
| Tasks completed     | Progress measurement      | 0 for 3+ iterations          |
| Files modified      | Change velocity           | 0 for 3+ iterations          |
| Test pass rate      | Quality trend             | Declining for 3+ iterations  |
| Error frequency     | Stagnation early warning  | Increasing for 3+ iterations |
| Output volume       | Productivity trend        | 70% decline                  |
| API calls remaining | Rate limit proximity      | <20% remaining               |
| Progress score      | Overall health            | Negative for 3 iterations    |

| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Ignore stagnation signals                   | Wastes hours on unsolvable problems      | Open circuit at threshold breach               |

| Skip file protection checks                 | Config deletion derails entire project   | Always verify protected files after operations |
| Set cooldown to zero                        | Rapid cycling through same failure       | Respect 30-minute minimum cooldown             |
| Count test-fix-only iterations as progress  | Masks the real problem (flawed approach) | Flag >80% test-fix effort as stagnation        |
| Delete and recreate protected files         | Loses configuration state                | Never delete protected files, only update      |
| Ignore rate limit warnings                  | Hits hard limit mid-operation            | Prioritize when at 80% of limit                |
| Run destructive commands without pre-checks | May delete protected files               | Always check affected files first              |

## Anti-Rationalization Guards

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "One more try will fix it"             | That is what you said 3 iterations ago. Open the circuit.                      |
| "The error is almost fixed"            | "Almost" for 5 iterations means the approach is wrong.                         |
| "I cannot stop now, I am so close"     | Sunk cost fallacy. Open circuit, reassess.                                     |
| "The cooldown is too long"             | The cooldown prevents wasting more time on the same failure.                   |
| "These config files are not important" | They are protected for a reason. Do not delete them.                           |
| "The rate limit will not be hit"       | Track it. Do not guess.                                                        |
| "This is a different error"            | Check if it is truly different or the same root cause manifesting differently. |

> **Do NOT override an open circuit. Follow the recovery protocol.**

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `resilient-execution`            | Task-level retries (3 attempts). Circuit-breaker activates AFTER resilient-execution exhausts retries within individual tasks. |
| `autonomous-loop`                | Circuit-breaker monitors the loop. Opens circuit when loop-level stagnation detected.                                          |
| `ralph-status`                   | Status block provides metrics for stagnation detection.                                                                        |
| `verification-before-completion` | Circuit-breaker ensures verification passes before closing a loop.                                                             |
| `self-learning`                  | Stagnation patterns are persisted to memory for future avoidance.                                                              |
| `auto-improvement`               | Circuit-breaker events feed into improvement metrics.                                                                          |
| `task-management`                | Upstream — tracks tasks that trigger circuit breaker                                                                           |

### Scope Clarification

| Scope      | Skill                 | Behavior                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Task-level | `resilient-execution` | Try 3 approaches for a single failing task                   |
| Loop-level | `circuit-breaker`     | Halt the entire loop when patterns indicate systemic failure |

The circuit breaker activates AFTER resilient-execution has exhausted its retries within individual tasks. If tasks keep failing despite 3 retries each, the circuit breaker detects the pattern.

## Process Summary

1. **Before each loop iteration:** Check circuit state (CLOSED/HALF-OPEN/OPEN)
2. **If OPEN:** Report status, wait for cooldown, or escalate
3. **If HALF-OPEN:** Allow one probe iteration, evaluate result
4. **If CLOSED:** Execute normally, monitor all thresholds
5. **After each iteration:** Update metrics, compute progress score, evaluate thresholds
6. **If threshold exceeded:** Open circuit, report reason, begin cooldown
7. **After cooldown:** Enter HALF-OPEN, allow one probe
8. **After probe:** Close if successful, re-open with doubled cooldown if failed

---

## Skill Type

**RIGID** — Thresholds and protection rules must be followed exactly. Do not relax circuit breaker conditions. Do not override open circuits. Do not skip file protection checks. Do not ignore stagnation signals.
