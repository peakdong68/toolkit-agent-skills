# Task Management

## Overview

Task management converts approved plans into bite-sized, trackable tasks and orchestrates their execution with progress reporting and checkpoint reviews. Each task is a single action that takes 2-5 minutes. The skill provides structured progress tracking, regular checkpoints, and integration with code review to maintain quality throughout execution.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the task-management skill to break this plan into tracked tasks."

## Trigger Conditions

- An approved plan document needs to be converted into executable tasks
- Multi-step implementation needs structured progress tracking
- Work needs checkpoint reviews at regular intervals
- `/execute` command used with a plan that needs task breakdown
- Transition from planning skill with an approved plan

---

## Phase 1: Plan Parsing

**Goal:** Extract all tasks from the approved plan with correct ordering and dependencies.

1. Read the approved plan document from start to finish
2. If `task-decomposition` has produced a WBS, load it — use pre-decomposed tasks, dependencies, and estimates instead of extracting manually
3. Extract every implementation step as a discrete task (skip if WBS already provides them)
4. Identify dependencies between tasks (what must complete first)
5. Order tasks by dependency — independent tasks first
6. Confirm task list with the user before beginning execution

### Task Granularity Rules

| Granularity               | Example                                         | Verdict                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Single action, 2-5 min    | "Write the failing test for UserService.create" | Correct                              |
| Single action, 2-5 min    | "Run the test to verify it fails"               | Correct                              |
| Single action, 2-5 min    | "Implement the minimal code to pass the test"   | Correct                              |
| Multiple actions, 30+ min | "Implement the authentication system"           | Too large — decompose                |
| Trivial, < 1 min          | "Add a blank line"                              | Too small — merge with adjacent task |

### Task Specification Template

```
Task N: [Clear, specific description]
Files: [Exact paths to create/modify/test]
Depends on: [Task numbers that must complete first, or "none"]
Verification: [Exact command to confirm completion]
```

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until:**

- [ ] Every plan step has been converted to 2-5 minute tasks
- [ ] Dependencies are mapped (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Every task has a verification command
- [ ] Task list is confirmed with user

---

## Phase 2: Task Execution

**Goal:** Execute tasks one at a time with verification after each.

### Per-Task Workflow

1. **Announce** — Report which task is starting: `[N/Total] Starting: <description>`
2. **Set status** — Mark task as `in_progress`
3. **Execute** — Perform the task (follow TDD if writing code)
4. **Verify** — Run the verification command
5. **Read output** — Confirm verification matches success criteria
6. **Report** — Show completion: `[N/Total] Completed: <description>`
7. **Set status** — Mark task as `completed`

### Execution Rules

| Rule                           | Rationale                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| One task at a time             | Prevents context switching errors         |
| Verify before marking complete | No false completions                      |
| Read verification output fully | Do not assume success from partial output |
| Follow TDD for code tasks      | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle                  |
| Do not skip ahead              | Dependencies may not be satisfied         |

### Task Status Flow

```
pending → in_progress → completed
                     → blocked (needs user input)
                     → failed (invoke resilient-execution)
```

### Status Decision Table

| Outcome                           | New Status    | Action                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Verification passes               | `completed`   | Proceed to next task               |
| Verification fails, fixable       | `in_progress` | Fix and re-verify                  |
| Verification fails, unclear cause | `failed`      | Invoke `resilient-execution` skill |
| Needs user decision               | `blocked`     | Report blocker, pause task         |
| Task depends on blocked task      | `pending`     | Skip to next non-blocked task      |

**Do NOT proceed to next task until current task verification passes.**

---

## Phase 3: Checkpoint Review

**Goal:** Pause every 3 tasks to assess progress and quality.

### Checkpoint Trigger Table

| Condition                                    | Action                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3 tasks completed since last checkpoint      | Mandatory checkpoint   |
| Logical batch complete (e.g., one component) | Checkpoint recommended |
| Test failure encountered                     | Immediate checkpoint   |
| User requests status                         | Ad-hoc checkpoint      |

### Checkpoint Steps

1. Show progress summary
2. Run full test suite (not just new tests)
3. Run lint, type-check, build as applicable
4. Dispatch `code-review` skill if significant code was written
5. Ask user if direction is still correct

### Progress Report Format

After each task:

```
[3/15] Task completed: Write failing test for UserService.create
       Files: tests/services/user.test.ts
       Verification: npm test -- --grep "UserService.create" — PASS
```

After each checkpoint:

```
── Checkpoint [6/15] ──
Completed: 6 | Remaining: 9 | Blocked: 0
Tests: 12 passing, 0 failing
Lint: clean | Build: passing
Next batch: Tasks 7-9 (API endpoint implementation)
Continue? [yes / adjust plan / stop here]
```

**STOP — Do NOT proceed to next batch until:**

- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Checkpoint report presented to user
- [ ] User has confirmed to continue

---

## Phase 4: Batch Review

**Goal:** After completing a logical group of tasks, perform quality review.

1. Dispatch `code-reviewer` agent to review the batch
2. Fix any Critical or Important issues before proceeding
3. Commit the batch with a descriptive conventional commit message
4. Update the plan document with completed status

### Review Issue Handling

| Severity   | Action                       | Continue?                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Critical   | Must fix immediately         | No — fix first             |
| Important  | Should fix before next batch | Conditional — user decides |
| Suggestion | Note for future              | Yes — proceed              |

**STOP — Do NOT start next batch until:**

- [ ] Review issues at Critical severity are resolved
- [ ] Batch is committed
- [ ] Plan document is updated

---

## Phase 5: Completion

**Goal:** Verify all tasks are done and report final status.

1. Confirm all tasks have `completed` status
2. Run final full test suite
3. Run all verification commands
4. Present final summary to user
5. Invoke `verification-before-completion` skill

### Final Summary Format

```
── FINAL SUMMARY ──
Total tasks: 15 | Completed: 15 | Failed: 0
Tests: 42 passing, 0 failing
Build: passing | Lint: clean
Commits: 5 (conventional format)

All tasks from plan docs/changes/2026-05-15_tool-search/plan.md are complete.
Verification-before-completion: PASS
```

## Anti-Patterns / Common Mistakes

| Anti-Pattern                           | Why It Fails                        | Correct Approach                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Marking complete without verification  | False progress, bugs accumulate     | Run verification command, read output       |
| Tasks larger than 5 minutes            | Hard to track, prone to scope creep | Break into 2-5 minute tasks                 |
| Skipping checkpoints                   | Quality degrades, direction drifts  | Checkpoint every 3 tasks                    |
| Running only new tests                 | Regressions go undetected           | Full test suite at checkpoints              |
| Parallelizing dependent tasks          | Race conditions, merge conflicts    | One task at a time unless truly independent |
| Proceeding past blocked tasks silently | User unaware of skipped work        | Report all blockers explicitly              |
| Not committing at batch boundaries     | Large, hard-to-review changesets    | Commit after each logical batch             |
| "It works, I'll verify later"          | Later never comes                   | Verify NOW                                  |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Guards

<HARD-GATE>
NO TASK MARKED COMPLETE WITHOUT VERIFICATION. Run the verification command. Read the output. Confirm it matches expectations. Only then mark complete.
</HARD-GATE>

If you catch yourself thinking:

- "The code looks right, I don't need to run it..." — Run it. Always.
- "I'll batch the verifications..." — No. Verify each task individually.
- "This task is trivial, it obviously works..." — Prove it with verification.

## Concrete Examples

### Example: Task Extraction from Plan

Plan step: "Add user registration endpoint with validation"

Extracted tasks:

```
Task 1: Write failing test for POST /api/users input validation
  Files: tests/api/users.test.ts
  Depends on: none
  Verification: npm test -- --grep "POST /api/users validation" → FAIL (expected)

Task 2: Implement input validation schema
  Files: src/schemas/user.ts
  Depends on: Task 1
  Verification: npm test -- --grep "POST /api/users validation" → PASS

Task 3: Write failing test for POST /api/users success case
  Files: tests/api/users.test.ts
  Depends on: Task 2
  Verification: npm test -- --grep "POST /api/users creates user" → FAIL (expected)

Task 4: Implement registration endpoint handler
  Files: src/routes/users.ts
  Depends on: Task 3
  Verification: npm test -- --grep "POST /api/users" → ALL PASS

Task 5: Commit registration endpoint
  Files: none (git operation)
  Depends on: Task 4
  Verification: git log --oneline -1 → shows conventional commit
```

### Example: Blocked Task Report

```
BLOCKED: Task 7 — Write integration test for payment webhook
Reason: Stripe test API key not configured in .env.test
Impact: Tasks 7-9 (payment flow) cannot proceed
Non-blocked tasks: Tasks 10-12 (profile page) can continue

Options:
A. User provides Stripe test key → unblocks Tasks 7-9
B. Skip payment tasks, continue with profile → revisit later
C. Mock Stripe entirely → reduces test fidelity

Awaiting direction.
```

## Key Principles

- **One task at a time** — Do not parallelize unless tasks are truly independent
- **Verify after each task** — Run the verification command before marking complete
- **Checkpoint regularly** — Every 3 tasks, pause and assess
- **Track everything** — No task without a status
- **Small commits** — Commit after each logical batch

---

## Skill Type

**RIGID** — Follow this process exactly. Every task gets verified. Every 3 tasks get a checkpoint. No exceptions.
